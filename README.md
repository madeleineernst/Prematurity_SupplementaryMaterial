## IonRichness_ShannonDiversity

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to calculate Shannon diversity and ion richness (Figure 1c Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).

## CorrelationAnalysis

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to assess and plot univariate correlation at the individual metabolite level using Kendallâ€™s Tau (Supplementary Data 1). 

## LASSO

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook adapted from [Wilamnski and collaborators (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0233-9) available at: [https://github.com/PriceLab/ShannonMets](https://github.com/PriceLab/ShannonMets) used to predict gestational age from the neonatal metabolome using a tenfold cross-validation (CV) implementation of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO). 

## PCoA

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to create the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) used to assess the variation in the metabolome explained by gestational age. 

## VennDiagram

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to create the Venn diagram illustrating overlapping metabolites significantly associated with gestational age by univariate correlation analysis, hypergeometric testing at the molecular family level and LASSO regression (Figure 1d).
