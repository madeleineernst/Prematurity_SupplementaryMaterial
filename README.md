## IonRichness_ShannonDiversity

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to calculate Shannon diversity and ion richness (Figure 1c Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).

## CorrelationAnalysis

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to assess and plot univariate correlation at the individual metabolite level using Kendallâ€™s Tau (Supplementary Data 1). 

## VennDiagram

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to create the Venn diagram illustrating overlapping metabolites significantly associated with gestational age by univariate correlation analysis, hypergeometric testing at the molecular family level and LASSO regression (Figure 1d).
